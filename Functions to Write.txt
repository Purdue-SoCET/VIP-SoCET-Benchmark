General Notes:
- we can write functions in terms of floats for now and then do an overall conversion later on.
- try not to do any #include in the C files because we will have to write our own for those. 
- https://github.com/JakeStevens/RISCVBusiness/tree/master/verification/c-tests/RV32I
- going to probably have to use file IO right now but could look into memory access in a similar manner
- ideally want to compile using LLVM but GCC is probably fine for now

complete sum of 100% pref
load_data() --- Tucker
- pref a function that can load any number of images from the python data set
- loading the data from the keras load_data() function in the model
- 28x28 (may be scaled later) and then label as well
load_weights() --- Tucker
- get the layer weights from the python model and then transfer them to C
